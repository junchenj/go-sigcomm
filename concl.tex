\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we presented the case for and an early instantiation of
a global control platform to manage QoS-sensitive Internet
applications such as Internet video streaming. To handle the
ever-increasing choice space (e.g., on CDN, video encoding, video
bitrate, server, path or route, etc), we take a predictive and
data-driven approach that can choose better initial configurations and
respond to Internet events more quickly than the reactive approaches
most Internet applications rely on today. We argue for an approach
that collects information from all elements in the eco-system (e.g.,
video sessions, servers, routers) and uses this information to predict
the quality metrics of a new session given its attributes.  Building
such systems in practice, however, is challenging due to prediction
errors.  We presented the design of GO, a global video control
platform that addresses these challenges and provides near-optimal
quality metrics that GO optimizes.  We also share our early experience
with deploying GO for one video site.  While the potential of GO is
still constrained by deployment limitations and business policies, it
is nevertheless a very promising first step towards a global control
platform.
