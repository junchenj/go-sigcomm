\tightsection{Related Work}
We briefly highlight two areas of research to place our work in context.

\tightsubsection{QoS of Internet video}
\myparatight{Quality metrics} 
A key aspect in  video delivery is to optimize user-perceived  quality of experience.  There is evidence that
users are sensitive to buffering ratio (e.g., \cite{sigcomm11}) and frequent changes in bitrate (e.g.,~\cite{user-adaptive,videoqoe}). More recent studies show a more causal relationsihpe betwen quality and user engagement~\cite{akamai-imc12}. The design of a good QoE metric (e.g., \cite{qscore}) is still an active area of research. As our understanding of video QoE matures, we can extend GO to be QoE-aware (as suggested in ~\cite{sekar2012quest})

\myparatight{Client-side adaptation} This includes the work on identifying problems existing in client-adaptation algorithms (e.g.,~\cite{mmsys2011cisco}), interation between player logic and TCP (e.g.,~\cite{usenix12_ghobadi,nossdav12_esteban}), and better bitrate adaptation algorithm to improve quality (e.g.,~\cite{nossdav12_akhshabi,festive}). GO can be considered as an enhancement to client-side adaptation by making decisions based on the information collected from massive clients.

\myparatight{CDN and server selection} These efforts have demonstrated inefficiencies in CDN and server selection strategies~\cite{youtubecdn,youtube-infra}, and studied various techniques to improve video quality, including cross-CDN optimization (e.g., ~\cite{sigcomm12,sigcomm12cdnmulti}), CDN federation (e.g.,~\cite{peterson2013framework}) and the use of ISP-CDN (e.g., ~\cite{yu2012tradeoffs,frank2013pushing}).  While GO currently focuses on quality improvement via better CDN and bitrate selection, we expect GO and its techniques to help these techniques make more accurate decisions.

\myparatight{Other video measurement}  There is a large  literature in measuring the performance of video delivery quality including content popularity and access patterns (e.g.,~\cite{youtube-imc07}\cite{plissonneau2012longitudinal}) and flash crowds during highly popular events (e.g.,~\cite{beijing-imc09}). Using a dataset that provides similar panoramic view, ~\cite{jiang2013shedding} studies the structure of video quality problems in more dimensions (e.g., content provider and video type). GO's attribute-based prediction algorithm extends a similar structural analysis to quality prediction and study the effectiveness of predicting not only whether a session has quality problems, but also its quality.

\tightsubsection{Global optimization}

\myparatight{Control plane and centralized decisions} There is a long line of work in which the control plane is separated from the data plane (e.g.,~\cite{rcp,onix,4d,openflow}) and they focus on physical networks and the objectives are often packet forwarding behaviors and policy compliance in routing. In contrast, GO optimize application-level applications by controlling client-side devices and the objectives are performance or quality metrics.  

\myparatight{Controller scalability and fault-tolerance} By making control decisions at a centralized point, SDN and similar centralized systems create a single point-of-failure at the controller and previous research has proposed many related techniques to build a scalable and fault-tolerant controller/backend (e.g., ~\cite{tootoonchian2012controller,yan2007tesseract}). The implementation of GO backend leverages many existing techniques to make it scalable, efficient and resillient, including Spark~\cite{spark}, Hadoop and ...

\myparatight{Information sharing and data-driven} Information sharing has been used to make more informed decision in networking research since a decade before. These works (e.g.,~\cite{stemm2000network} and more recently, \cite{choffnes2010crowdsourcing}) explore the feasibility of a wide area measurement infrastructure to monitor network-level performance and inform application-level decisions. Sharing across multiple applications within a host is also studied (e.g., \cite{balakrishnan1999integrated}). They also suggest the inefficiency of using static model and argue for data-driven approach (e.g., ~\cite{Winstein:2013:TEM:2486001.2486020, sivaraman2013no}) to make parameters dynamically configured.
While these works try to optimize quality like GO, they require dedicated centralized sharing or distribute sharing infrastructure, and we rely only on instrumentation within video players to measure a wide-area performance by leveraging the dominance of video traffic in today's Internet. Moreover, GO deals with more attributes and requires a more complex model than these works whose network models do not include application-specific attributes, e.g., content provider or streaming protocols.
